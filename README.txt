To start we shall hit the slopes.

Slalom was one of the first games I ever witnessed on the computer, remember the yheti at then end? Watch out.

Anyways the point of this is goalposts. 

Remember:
 with no goals, we can achieve nothing. 
 with a finite set of goals, we achieve a finite set of goals. 
 with infinite set of goals, we achieve infinite set of goals.

And that's the intent of metest. 

Developing in C/C++ has been a blessing and curse. I have made my brain into a machine and I have learned how to master C/C++ which is compiled directly to assembly, which is the machine. 

I have not mastered C/C++, but the intent of this program is to do that for me and others so that they can return enjoying this beloved planet.

We need to standardize a format for our goalposts. I'm bent between JSON and XML so we'l allow both but I will stick to json for now.
